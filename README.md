# 📁 Freelancing Practice – C++ & Python Mini Projects

This repository showcases my practical programming projects developed during my learning journey with Python and C++. These mini-projects are focused on solving real-world tasks often found in freelancing jobs, such as file management, PDF processing, automation bots, and basic calculations.

🌱 I’m continuously learning and will keep updating this repository with more practice-based projects to strengthen my skills and prepare for freelance opportunities, inshaAllah.
