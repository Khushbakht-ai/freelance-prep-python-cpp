# 📁 Freelancing Practice – C++ & Python Mini Projects

This repository is part of my practical learning journey to prepare for freelancing tasks using **Python and C++**. I'm currently in the process of learning and building these projects step by step. 

I will keep updating this repository with new projects as I explore more concepts and improve my skills. These projects are for learning, practice, and eventually for offering small freelance services inshaAllah.
